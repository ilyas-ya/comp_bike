# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Component Compatibility System is a web application that provides intuitive compatibility checking between bicycle components. Users can select a frame and then choose components to see immediate visual feedback on compatibility through a color-coded system: green for compatible, orange for uncertain/conditional compatibility, and red for incompatible. The platform serves mechanics, workshops, and second-hand buyers who need quick, clear compatibility verification.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with a visual bike diagram where I can hover over and click on specific components, so that I can intuitively select the parts I want to check compatibility for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads the application THEN the system SHALL display a visual bike diagram with clickable component areas
2. WHEN a user hovers over a bike component THEN the system SHALL highlight that component area on the bike diagram
3. WHEN a user clicks on a highlighted component THEN the system SHALL open a search interface for that specific component category
4. WHEN the search interface opens THEN the system SHALL display a search bar with component-specific filters
5. WHEN a user selects a component from search results THEN the system SHALL store this selection and update the bike diagram to show the selected component

### Requirement 1.1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to support the five main component categories with their specific compatibility factors, so that I can check all critical bike compatibility aspects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the bottom bracket area THEN the system SHALL provide search for Bottom Bracket & Crankset components with spindle type, shell width, and standard filters (BSA, BB30, DUB)
2. WHEN a user clicks on the rear derailleur/cassette area THEN the system SHALL provide search for Cassette & Derailleur components with gear range, spacing, and pull ratio specifications
3. WHEN a user clicks on the brake areas THEN the system SHALL provide search for Brake System components with type (mechanical/hydraulic), mounting standard, rotor size, and brand filters
4. WHEN a user clicks on the wheel areas THEN the system SHALL provide search for Wheel components with axle type (quick release/thru-axle), spacing, and rotor mounting options
5. WHEN a user clicks on the seatpost area THEN the system SHALL provide search for Seatpost components with diameter, insertion length, and saddle clamp compatibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to check compatibility between any two components directly, so that I can verify if specific parts will work together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects two components for comparison THEN the system SHALL analyze their compatibility
2. WHEN components are fully compatible THEN the system SHALL display a green indicator with "YES"
3. WHEN component compatibility is uncertain or requires conditions THEN the system SHALL display an orange indicator with "TBD"
4. WHEN components are incompatible THEN the system SHALL display a red indicator with "NO"
5. WHEN displaying compatibility results THEN the system SHALL provide brief explanations for the compatibility status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily browse and search for frames and components, so that I can quickly find the parts I'm interested in checking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the component selection interface THEN the system SHALL provide organized categories for frames and component types
2. WHEN a user searches for a specific frame or component THEN the system SHALL provide filtered results with auto-complete suggestions
3. WHEN browsing component categories THEN the system SHALL display components with essential identifying information (brand, model, key specs)
4. WHEN a user selects a component THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the selection and update compatibility displays accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage the component database and compatibility rules both manually and through automated data collection, so that I can maintain accurate and up-to-date compatibility information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the admin interface THEN the system SHALL provide forms for adding and editing frames, components, and compatibility rules
2. WHEN adding new compatibility rules THEN the system SHALL validate the rules for consistency
3. WHEN updating component data THEN the system SHALL automatically update related compatibility calculations
4. WHEN managing bulk data THEN the system SHALL provide import/export functionality with validation feedback
5. WHEN the AI scraping agent runs THEN the system SHALL automatically collect component data and specifications from supplier websites
6. WHEN new data is scraped THEN the system SHALL validate and queue it for admin review before integration
7. WHEN scraped data conflicts with existing data THEN the system SHALL flag discrepancies for manual resolution

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web application to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes, so that I can use it on desktop, tablet, or mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application on different devices THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive layout that adapts to screen size
2. WHEN using touch devices THEN the system SHALL provide appropriately sized touch targets for component selection
3. WHEN viewing compatibility results on smaller screens THEN the system SHALL maintain clear color coding and readable text
4. WHEN the interface adapts to mobile THEN the system SHALL preserve all core functionality while optimizing for touch interaction

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast performance when checking compatibility, so that I can quickly evaluate multiple component combinations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a frame or component THEN the system SHALL update compatibility indicators within 1 second
2. WHEN browsing component lists THEN the system SHALL load and display components without noticeable delays
3. WHEN searching for components THEN the system SHALL provide real-time search results as the user types
4. WHEN the system processes compatibility checks THEN it SHALL handle multiple simultaneous requests efficiently
