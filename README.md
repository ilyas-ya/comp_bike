## What is comp.bike?

**comp.bike** is an open-source web application that addresses a major challenge in the cycling industry: ensuring interoperability and compatibility between components across different bicycle brands and standards. 

Targeted at mechanics, workshops, and second-hand buyers, the platform provides intuitive compatibility checking between bicycle components with real-time visual feedback through a color-coded system: green for compatible, orange for uncertain/conditional compatibility, and red for incompatible.

---

## Key Features

### Interactive Visual Interface
- **Interactive bike diagram** with clickable component areas
- **Hover effects** and visual highlighting for intuitive component selection
- **Color-coded compatibility feedback** (green/orange/red) for instant visual understanding
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Comprehensive Component Support
The system supports compatibility checking for 5 main component categories:

1. **Bottom Bracket & Crankset** - BSA, BB30, DUB standards with spindle type and shell width
2. **Cassette & Derailleur** - Gear range, spacing, pull ratio, and brand compatibility
3. **Brake System** - Mechanical/hydraulic types, mounting standards, rotor sizes
4. **Wheel & Frame Interface** - Axle types (QR/thru-axle), spacing, rotor mounting
5. **Seatpost** - Diameter, insertion length, saddle clamp compatibility

### Advanced Compatibility Logic
- **Frame-centric workflow** - Select a frame and check component compatibility
- **Component-to-component checking** - Direct compatibility verification between any two parts
- **Adapter suggestions** - Recommendations for making incompatible components work together
- **Confidence scoring** - Each compatibility result includes a confidence level
- **Alternative suggestions** - System suggests compatible alternatives when conflicts arise

### Data Management & Automation
- **Admin interface** for manual data entry and management
- **AI-powered web scraping** service for automated component data collection
- **Bulk import/export** functionality with validation
- **Conflict resolution** system for handling data discrepancies
- **REST API** with comprehensive documentation

## How Kiro Was Used

This project was developed as part of the [Kiro Hackathon](https://kiro.devpost.com/) using **Kiro**, the AI-powered IDE, throughout the entire development process.

### Specification & Architecture Phase
Kiro helped us:
- Define the comprehensive requirements document with user stories and acceptance criteria
- Design the technical architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Create detailed data models for components, frames, standards, and compatibility rules
- Plan the API structure and endpoint specifications
- Establish the testing strategy and performance considerations

### Development Phase
Kiro accelerated development by:
- **Backend Development**: Generated complete Django models, serializers, views, and URL configurations
- **Database Design**: Created optimized database schemas with proper indexing and relationships
- **API Implementation**: Built RESTful endpoints with filtering, pagination, and search capabilities
- **Frontend Scaffolding**: Set up Next.js project structure with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Docker Configuration**: Created production-ready Docker Compose setup with all services
- **Code Quality**: Ensured consistent code style and best practices across the entire codebase

Kiro made it possible to go from concept to a fully functional, scalable application architecture in record time, allowing us to focus on the unique compatibility logic rather than boilerplate code.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Django 4.2, Django REST Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 with Redis caching
- **AI Scraping**: Python with BeautifulSoup/Scrapy
- **Deployment**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **IDE**: Kiro AI-powered development environment

## API Documentation

The system provides a comprehensive REST API:

### Core Endpoints
- `GET /api/components/` - List components with filtering and search
- `POST /api/compatibility/check/` - Check compatibility between components
- `GET /api/frames/` - List bike frames with specifications
- `GET /api/standards/` - List mechanical standards and categories

### Advanced Features
- **Pagination** - All list endpoints support pagination
- **Filtering** - Filter by category, brand, specifications, etc.
- **Search** - Full-text search across component names and descriptions
- **Caching** - Redis caching for improved performance
- **Rate Limiting** - API rate limiting for production use

Visit http://localhost:8000/api/docs/ for interactive API documentation.

## Compatibility Logic

The system uses a sophisticated multi-layered approach:

1. **Explicit Rules** - Manually defined compatibility rules with high confidence
2. **Specification Matching** - Automatic checking based on component specifications  
3. **Standard Cross-referencing** - Compatibility based on mechanical standards
4. **Adapter Integration** - Suggestions for adapters to resolve incompatibilities

### Color-Coded Results
- üü¢ **Green (Compatible)** - Components work together directly
- üü† **Orange (Conditional)** - May work with adapters or under specific conditions
- üî¥ **Red (Incompatible)** - Components cannot work together
